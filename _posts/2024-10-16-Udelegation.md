## Introduction
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The `double-hop problem` emerged in the early 2000s as applications required seamless user authentication across multiple services. To address this, Microsoft introduced Kerberos delegation in Windows Server 2003, enabling trusted accounts (user or computer) to act on behalf of users across services. Unconstrained delegation allows an account with the `TrustedForDelegation` attribute to impersonate any userâ€”except those in `Protected Users` or marked as `Account is sensitive and cannot be delegated`.
