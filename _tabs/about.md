![Self Injection](../assets/img/default/whoami.png)<br>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
I'm <em>gilles karougbe</em>, a cybersecutity enthusiast and fresh graduate as information security and cybersecurity state engineer. I'm always looking for ways to sharpen my hacking skills to better contribute to the filed. I have started this blog to document my journey, share my ctf walkthroughs and share my  thoughts. My goal is to continuously learn, improve and grow. I'm not an expert (at least not yet hahaha...), if you find some gaps in my  knowledge just make sure you teaches me on your way—I'm probaly not aware of them. I hope this blog becomes a valuable resource for others on a similar path.</p>
